1. Project Overview: 
The project entails the development of a client-server application utilizing Python's socket module.
The primary objective is to establish a seamless communication channel between a client and a server, facilitating the exchange of messages.
This entails sending messages from the client to the server, where the server processes these messages by reversing them, and subsequently
sends the reversed messages back to the client. This interaction occurs over a TCP/IP connection, offering a reliable and efficient means of
communication between the client and server.

2. Program Explanation:
The program comprises two distinct components: the server-side script and the client-side script.
Server-side script:
•	Initiates a server socket utilizing socket.socket(), utilizing the AF_INET address family for IPv4 compatibility and the SOCK_STREAM socket type for TCP protocol.
•	Binds the server socket to a specified IP address and port using bind().
•	Listens for incoming connections from clients employing listen().
•	Accepts incoming client connections via accept().
•	Processes messages received from the client by reversing them utilizing a custom function reverse_message(), and subsequently transmits the reversed message back to the client.
•	Closes the client socket upon completion of communication with a particular client.
•	Incorporates error handling mechanisms and ensures the closure of the server socket at the end.

Client-side script:
•	Initializes a client socket utilizing socket.socket(), employing the AF_INET address family and SOCK_STREAM socket type.
•	Establishes a connection with the server using connect().
•	Facilitates user interaction by prompting for input, sending the provided message to the server, and awaits the reversed message in return.
•	Terminates the communication process upon user input of "end".
•	Implements robust error handling routines and ensures the closure of the client socket upon completion.

3. Output Explanation:
The output encompasses a series of informational messages denoting the status of the connection between the client and server,
as well as the reversed messages received from the server. It includes notifications pertaining to errors or exceptions encountered during the execution of the code
